	<h1>REQUIREMENTS</h1>

Energy-Telecom.org is a web-based application (online form) <br>
created for collecting data about contact information and telecommunication/energy <br>
services needs of a person (household). <br>
That information will be given to an ACN services broker as a sales lead. <br>
The most valuable data is the contact information. The services information <br>
is somewhat important but the broker will find further detail on needs and <br>
existing services from the prospect.<br>
The collected data types should be consistent with data types collected by similar <br>
applications usedin both Telecommunication and Energy services.<br>
State specific adjustment should be made.<br>
The collected data is saved in the database
Upon the form being submitted the application generates an email <br>
(sales leads) with all the information available in the form.<br>
The application shouldbe compliant with basic GUI guidelines for WEB applications
